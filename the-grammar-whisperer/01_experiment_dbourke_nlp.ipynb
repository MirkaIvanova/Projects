Aside from CSV files (what we're working with), you'll probably encounter `.txt` files and `.json` files too. For working with these type of files, I'd recommend reading the two following articles by RealPython:\n","* [How to Read and Write Files in Python](https://realpython.com/read-write-files-python/)\n","* [Working with JSON Data in Python](https://realpython.com/python-json/)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"qRvkeYEJIKsw","outputId":"641b4d32-b3fe-44e1-8f6a-d1bb04552496","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1736881689018,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":341,"user":{"displayName":"Miroslava Ivanova","userId":"04041431527474936486"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   id keyword location                                               text  \\\n","0   1     NaN      NaN  Our Deeds are the Reason of this #earthquake M...   \n","1   4     NaN      NaN             Forest fire near La Ronge Sask.

We've got a training set and a validation set containing Tweets and labels.\n","\n","Our labels are in numerical form (`0` and `1`) but our Tweets are in string form.\n","\n","> 🤔 **Question:** What do you think we have to do before we can use a machine learning algorithm with our text data?\n","\n","If you answered something along the lines of \"turn it into numbers\", you're correct. A machine learning algorithm requires its inputs to be in numerical form.\n","\n","In NLP, there are two main concepts for turning text into numbers:\n","* **Tokenization** - A straight mapping from word or character or sub-word to a numerical value. There are three main levels of tokenization:\n","  1. Using **word-level tokenization** with the sentence \"I love TensorFlow\" might result in \"I\" being `0`, \"love\" being `1` and \"TensorFlow\" being `2`. In this case, every word in a sequence considered a single **token**.\n","  2. **Character-level tokenization**, such as converting the letters A-Z to values `1-26`. In this case, every character in a sequence considered a single **token**.\n","  3. **Sub-word tokenization** is in between word-level and character-level tokenization. It involves breaking invidual words into smaller parts and then converting those smaller parts into numbers. For example, \"my favourite food is pineapple pizza\" might become \"my, fav, avour, rite, fo, oo, od, is, pin, ine, app, le, piz, za\". After doing this, these sub-words would then be mapped to a numerical value. In this case, every word could be considered multiple **tokens**.\n","* **Embeddings** - An embedding is a representation of natural language which can be learned. Representation comes in the form of a **feature vector**. For example, the word \"dance\" could be represented by the 5-dimensional vector `[-0.8547, 0.4559, -0.3332, 0.9877, 0.1112]`. It's important to note here, the size of the feature vector is tuneable. There are two ways to use embeddings:\n","  1. **Create your own embedding** - Once your text has been turned into numbers (required for an embedding), you can put them through an embedding layer (such as [`tf.keras.layers.Embedding`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Embedding)) and an embedding representation will be learned during model training.\n","  2. **Reuse a pre-learned embedding** - Many pre-trained embeddings exist online. These pre-trained embeddings have often been learned on large corpuses of text (such as all of Wikipedia) and thus have a good underlying representation of natural language. You can use a pre-trained embedding to initialize your model and fine-tune it to your own specific task.\n","\n","![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/main/images/08-tokenization-vs-embedding.png)\n","*Example of **tokenization** (straight mapping from word to number) and **embedding** (richer representation of relationships between tokens).*\n","\n","> 🤔 **Question:** What level of tokenzation should I use? What embedding should should I choose?\n","\n","It depends on your problem. You could try character-level tokenization/embeddings and word-level tokenization/embeddings and see which perform best. You might even want to try stacking them (e.g. combining the outputs of your embedding layers using [`tf.keras.layers.concatenate`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/concatenate)).\n","\n","If you're looking for pre-trained word embeddings, [Word2vec embeddings](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/), [GloVe embeddings](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) and many of the options available on [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/s?module-type=text-embedding) are great places to start.\n","\n","> 🔑 **Note:** Much like searching for a pre-trained computer vision model, you can search for pre-trained word embeddings to use for your problem.

For example, in our case, we might combine our baseline, our bidirectional model and our TensorFlow Hub USE model.\n","\n","Although these models are all trained on the same data, they all have a different way of finding patterns.\n","\n","If we were to use three similarly trained models, such as three LSTM models, the predictions they output will likely be very similar.\n","\n","Think of it as trying to decide where to eat with your friends. If you all have similar tastes, you'll probably all pick the same restaurant. But if you've all got different tastes and still end up picking the same restaurant, the restaurant must be good.\n","\n","Since we're working with a classification problem, there are a few of ways we can combine our models:\n","1. **Averaging** - Take the output prediction probabilities of each model for each sample, combine them and then average them.\n","2. **Majority vote (mode)** - Make class predictions with each of your models on all samples, the predicted class is the one in majority. For example, if three different models predict `[1, 0, 1]` respectively, the majority class is `1`, therefore, that would be the predicted label.\n","3. **Model stacking** - Take the outputs of each of your chosen models and use them as inputs to another model.\n","\n","> 📖 **Resource:** The above methods for model stacking/ensembling were adapted from Chapter 6 of the [Machine Learning Engineering Book](http://www.mlebook.com/wiki/doku.php) by Andriy Burkov.
